# PostgreSQL
Script created to automate the backup of DB's in PostgreSQL using Windows scheduled tasks
Credit to persons who shared parts of this code helping to speed up the creation of this script without re-inventing the wheel or the code in this case ;)
Use at your own discretion.
My use case was to backup VMware Cloud Director DB's keeping it simple. Room for improvement is and tunning is there
